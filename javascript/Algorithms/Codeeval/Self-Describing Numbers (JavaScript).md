# Self-Describing Numbers

### Description

A number is a self-describing number when (assuming digit positions are labeled 0 to N-1), the digit in each position is equal to the number of times that that digit appears in the number.

**Input sample:**

The first argument is the pathname to a file which contains one positive integer per line.

> 2020<br />22<br />1210<br >

**Output sample:**

If the number is a self-describing number, print out a 1. If not, print out a 0 eg.

> 1<br/>0<br/>1
