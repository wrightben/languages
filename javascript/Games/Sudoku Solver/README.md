### Solving
A sudoku solution doesn't excite me, though I enjoyed writing the functions. It might be nice to have a sudoku solver to test generated puzzles. I wonder if there are any valid puzzles that cannot be solved using this algorithm. If sudokus are your work or hobby, send me your thoughts.

#### Files

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ./solver.js: creates the regex list (and may eventually solve a puzzle) <br />
> ./filter/filter.sh: greps a cell's row, column and box

> [!NOTE]
> ./extraneous - puzzle helper/puzzle helper.numbers: Visual aid of the puzzle grid using the puzzle, the regexes and the cell indicies. Use solver.js to create the data.<br />
> ./extraneous - rows columns boxes/intersections.js: creates the arrays of the rows, boxes and columns used in the other files. It's not needed anymore, but it might be useful for parts in the future.
