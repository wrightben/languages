### Files
- ./solver.js: creates the regex list (and may eventually solve a puzzle)
- ./filter/filter.sh: greps a cell's row, column and box

- ./extraneous - puzzle helper/puzzle helper.numbers: Visual aid of the puzzle grid using the puzzle, the regexes, and the cell indicies.
- ./extraneous - rows columns boxes/intersections.js: creates the arrays of the rows, boxes and columns used in the other files. It's not needed anymore, but it might be useful for parts in the future.
