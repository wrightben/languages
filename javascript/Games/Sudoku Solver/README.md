### Solving
It might be nice to have a sudoku solver to test generated puzzles. I wonder if there are any valid puzzles that cannot be solved using this algorithm. I enjoyed writing the functions, but a sudoku solution doesn't excite me.

### Files
- ./solver.js: creates the regex list (and may eventually solve a puzzle)
- ./filter/filter.sh: greps a cell's row, column and box

- ./extraneous - puzzle helper/puzzle helper.numbers: Visual aid of the puzzle grid using the puzzle, the regexes and the cell indicies.
- ./extraneous - rows columns boxes/intersections.js: creates the arrays of the rows, boxes and columns used in the other files. It's not needed anymore, but it might be useful for parts in the future.
