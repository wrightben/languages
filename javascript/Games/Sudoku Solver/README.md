### Files
- ./puzzle helper/puzzle helper.numbers: Demonstrates how the puzzle looks in memory; Visual aid
- ./solver.js: creates the regex list (and may eventually solve a puzzle)

- ./extraneous - rows columns boxes/intersections.js: creates the arrays of the rows, boxes and columns used in the other files. It's not needed anymore, but it might be useful for parts in the future.
