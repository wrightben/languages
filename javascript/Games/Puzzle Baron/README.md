### Logic Puzzle
	
B-A-C (The relationship between B-C is implicit.)
The initial regular expression filters none of the 576 list elements.
- There are two kinds of alterations to the initial regular expression.
	- A known relationship
	- An exclusion

The clues tell you which alterations to make. But the language must be interpreted.
- The clues explain that
	- two things are related directly
	- two or more things are not related
	- one thing precedes another
	
Question: Can B-C be extracted and does the reduction of items yield numbers for unknowns? (Is it like Sudoku?)

Would I enjoy writing code that could parse the clues? No.
