1. Sometimes "o" has a winning plan for a row, col, or dia that offers more than one square choice. Example: set[0] = [1,2,3]. Its board values might look like [1,-1,-1]. Either of the -1 squares are open, but one might be more strategic than the other, perhaps claiming a row, col, or dia from "x". See screenshot.
