### Countries of the World

**NOTE**
One of the most functional educational tools I've ever used is the Countries of the World games created for PurposeGames.com.

I enjoyed them so much, I thought about reproducing them with some UI changes that would make them useful for people who had already memorized the countries.

This is probably the way I would implement it: https://simplemaps.com/world


#### Notes
I could just write a bookmarklet that gets the countries from the simplemaps.com URL and creates a game in their demo page. Any of the example maps could be used to select the countries.
