Play [Minesweeper](http://wrightben.com/minesweeper)

### Game Play

In the Google algorithm, a click on a clear square reveals all contiguous clear squares to a number. A click on a number reveals just that number. A click on a mine ends the game and reveals the board. The first click seems to be safe. I thought older versions allowed you to click a mine on the first click. I like this. Zeros will overwrite question marks when no bombs are present.

I think randomly distributed mines will often produce a puzzle that cannot always be solved with logic. I like this.

#### Solving

Solving minesweeper reminds me of a gif I saw once of a guy getting hit in the face with a loaded railroad rail.
