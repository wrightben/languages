Number of people who use the restroom
Random assignment of men and women (but weighted)
Adjustable probability that a man peeing would put the seat up to do so (meaning it needn't already be up)
Adjustable probability of peeing on the seat when it's down
Adjustable probability of a man needing/choosing to sit

Goal:
The estimation of work for a population-held decision to either:
1. Put the seat up at the end of bathroom use
2. 

I can run all kinds of these scenarios lot of times each.



Types of behavior:
One type of dude never puts the seat up, no matter what. He shits. Or he pees with it down.
One type of dude just puts it into his own configuration.
The other type of dudes put it into configuration and then put it into some programmed position

We wouldn't operate like that.
