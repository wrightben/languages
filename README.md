### Programming Languages

I associate learning a new programming language with suffering. I don't believe anyone other than me would ever look at this repo, but it's symbolic of a lifetime of virtual imprisonment in America. I sat in a room learning programming languages and didn't have friends or literally anything else.

No one calls it The Truman Show to my face.
